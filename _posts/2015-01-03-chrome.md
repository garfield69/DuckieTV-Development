# DuckieTV â™¥ Chrome


Unfortunately Chrome no longer loves DuckieTV. 
With the update of Chromium to version 124 the WEB SQL support in Chromium based Browsers such as Chrome, Opera, Edge, Vivaldi and Safari (to name a few) is no longer available. It is no longer possible to run DuckieTV as a Browser Extension.
